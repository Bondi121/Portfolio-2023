          In my ongoing NBA analytics project, I'm mining data from the
          2021-2022 season to uncover valuable insights and trends. Using
          Jupyter Notebook and popular libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib,
          Seaborn, Plotly, and Chloropleth, I analyze the data to gain insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          Extensive data collection and preprocessing ensures the accuracy and
          quality of the dataset. By applying statistical and visualization
          techniques, I aim to reveal patterns and provide insights into various
          aspects of the season, including player performance, team dynamics,
          and game strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          To improve accessibility, I create interactive charts, graphs, and
          visualizations that help better understand the results. The project is
          a work in progress, with ongoing data analysis and updates.

                compares two conferences based on different data points, such as
                3-point percentage, on-field goal percentage, assists, steals,
                blocks, and redirects, allowing you to correlation and potential
                differences between conferences. Boxed plots provide additional
                information on how the two conferences compare in terms of the
                data points in question, highlighting any significant
                differences that may exist.
