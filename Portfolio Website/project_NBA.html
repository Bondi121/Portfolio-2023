            <p>In my ongoing NBA analysis project, I explore the data from the 2021-2022 season to uncover valuable insights and trends. Utilizing Jupyter Notebook and popular libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Chloropleth, I analyze the data to gain a comprehensive understanding.</p>

            <p>Thorough data collection and preprocessing ensure the accuracy and quality of the dataset. By applying statistical techniques and visualizations, I aim to reveal patterns and provide insights into various aspects of the season, including player performance, team dynamics, and game strategies.</p>
            
            <p>To enhance accessibility, I create intuitive charts, graphs, and interactive visuals that facilitate a better understanding of the findings. The project is a work in progress, with ongoing analysis and updates to the data.</p>

The data is visualized using scatterplots and box whisker plots to explore the performance of NBA teams. The scatter plots compare the two conferences based on various data points such as 3-point percentage, field goal percentage, assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers, allowing you to analyze potential correlations and differences between the conferences. The box whisker plots provide further insights into how the two conferences compare in terms of the mentioned data points, highlighting any significant differences that may exist.
